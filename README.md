# EdgeSharpnessAnalysis


Jupyter notebook to apply the edge sharpness algorithm to an image containing sharp edges.

* All images must be specified as paths at the start of the notebook (image to analyse, white and dark images) along with the saving path.

* Parameters are preset to those used for the analysis to compare the curved and flat sensor setups.

* Perfect images used to compute the blurring size sigma (brute force method) are included in the folder.
